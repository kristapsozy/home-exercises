Create a test to test functionality and check that its possible to create basket with apples, basket with mushrooms and that exceptions are thrown.

#### NB! Basket can store only one kind of items - only apples, only mushrooms etc, it cannot store both apples and mushrooms at the same time.

Create two empty classes Apple and Mushroom.

The basket can store from 0 to 10 items. When a user wants to remove an element at 0 items state or add an element at 10 items state, throw the appropriate runtime exception (BasketFullException or BasketEmptyException, exceptions created by yourself).

Add the addToBasket() method, which adds the element to the basket (increasing the current state by 1) and the removeFromBasket() method, which removes the element from the basket (reducing the current state by 1).

Create a Basket<T> class that imitates a basket and stores multiple T items (any kind of items) and the current number of items in the basket.

#### (generics + exceptions + tests)
